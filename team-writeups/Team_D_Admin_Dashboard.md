ASSIGNMENT QUESTION:	 SUBMIT INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT PROTOTYPE

â€ƒ
My contribution to the design of the prototype
As per our group we divided in teams of two to focus specific task. I was in a team where we were supposed to come up with a design and the software architecture of the administrative dashboard and management.
What I contributed:
1.	Admin workflow strategy
I designed the admin workflow, which defines how university staff interact with the E-Admission portal to review applications.
2.	The review process (Submitted, Under Review and Approved or Rejected)
The three-stage process breaks down the complex task of application review into manageable steps, allowing staff to track progress and prioritize tasks effectively.
i.	Submitted- which shows the number of applications received.
ii.	Under review- which shows forms that are not yet approved and they are under processing.
iii.	Approved or rejected
It provides transparency and traceability, enabling administrators to monitor application statuses in real-time, allowing staff to track applications efficiently.
3.	Role-Based Access control
I designed a role-based access control to enhance security by restricting access based on roles, ensuring that sensitive data (e.g., applicant details) is only accessible to authorized personnel.
There are specified distinct roles (e.g., reviewer, supervisor, and administrator) with varying access levels, this helps to ensure that only authorized personnel can be able to perform specific actions
So I had to design the breakdown of each role specific admins have. This prevents unauthorized actions and protects data integrity.
4.	Application review system
I designed a dedicated review system that centralizes application processing, allowing staff to access all necessary information in one place enabling efficient application processing.
It improves efficiency by enabling quick access to application details and streamlining the review process, which is critical for meeting application deadlines.
5.	Application list interface
I designed the interface that will list applications when they are submitted by users. This will help staff to easily manage the applications which includes sort and filter options improving navigation efficiency.
This also enhances usability, enabling staff to focus on urgent tasks and reducing the time spent navigating through applications.
6.	Status update system
I designed a status update system that changes regarding the status of each form. For example from under review to Approved and comment fields for reviewer notes.

ASSIGNMENT QUESTION:  INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT PROTOTYPE
 






My contribution to the design of the prototype

As per our group's division of tasks, I played an integral role in designing and implementing the Administrative Dashboard and Management System. My focus was on the low-level implementation of the Dashboard Overview, a centralized platform empowering university staff to efficiently review and process student applications. The goal was to transform complex application data into an intuitive, decision-making tool by prioritizing usability, performance, and streamlined workflows.

What I contributed:

My work focused on the specification, design, and implementation of critical dashboard components to enhance usability and operational efficiency for administrators. My contributions include:

1. Design and Implementation of Statistics Cards
I designed real-time metrics cards to display key administrative data, providing at-a-glance insights for quick decision-making. My design included:
Total Applications: With trending indicators for Year-over-Year (YoY) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Pending Review: With color-coded urgency signals to help staff prioritize handling.
Approved/Rejected Rates: Displaying a success percentage with a drill-down capability for detailed analysis.
System Online Status: A server health indicator with automated alerts for IT staff.

To enable this, I defined the data sources, linking them to backend database tables and ensuring live updates via API polling.

2. Development of Application Trend Charts
I developed interactive line charts to visualize application submission patterns, such as daily and weekly trends. My contribution involved structuring the data aggregation pipelines from the database, which allows administrative staff to:
Identify peak application periods.
 Allocate resources and staff effectively to manage workload.

3. Implementation of Quick Action Buttons
To streamline workflows and reduce manual effort, I designed and implemented one-click shortcuts for high-frequency administrative tasks.
  Examples include buttons like "Start Review" and "Generate Report."
  I ensured seamless backend integration for these buttons, allowing for immediate task execution and significantly improving the efficiency of the application review process.
